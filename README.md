# Sakila lab

In this lab I will do data analysis on Sakila database ...

TODO: highlights from the lab
TODO: description about the lab
TODO: nice images/screenshots

- idea is to make someone directly understand what your lab is about to be interested to learn more

Task 0:
I first created the folder structure.
- data: Here I will have the databases.
- notebooks: Here I will put my jupyter notebooks.
- sql: Here I will put my queries and etc.
- dashboard: This one is for task 3.

Then I did uv init to have a virtual enviroment.
